# Projet 1

## Description

1) First we need to finish the first part (i.e the logo, Navigation, Contact us button) using  **_Display:flex_**;

2) After finishing the first part, we need to move to the second part where we have an text element with button and an image is used here also we can use #display:flex; to align the elements and use the **_"paragraph"_** and **_"span"_** tags to markup the text elements.
